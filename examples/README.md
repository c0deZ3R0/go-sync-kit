# Go Sync Kit Examples

> **üöß Work in Progress**: These examples are actively being updated to match the latest Go Sync Kit API changes. Some examples may not compile or function correctly until updates are complete. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

This directory contains various examples demonstrating different features and use cases of Go Sync Kit.

## Examples

### 1. [Basic Example](./basic/)
A comprehensive notes synchronization application with a real-time dashboard. This example demonstrates:
- Real-time event synchronization between client and server
- Live monitoring dashboard with metrics
- SQLite persistence with WAL mode
- Auto-sync capabilities
- Event terminal with detailed metadata

**Features:**
- Real-time web dashboard
- Event logging and monitoring
- Metrics collection and display
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 2. [Conflict Resolution](./conflict-resolution/)
An advanced example demonstrating conflict resolution in a distributed counter system. This example shows:
- Vector clock-based conflict resolution
- Multiple client synchronization
- Custom conflict resolution strategies
- Event-driven architecture
- Offline-first design

**Features:**
- Multiple client coordination
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- Vector clock versioning
- Comprehensive test suite
- PowerShell and batch scripts for easy testing

### 3. [Utilities](./utils/)
Collection of utility functions and examples for testing and development:
- Memory store implementations
- Mock transport for testing
- Cursor synchronization examples
- Test utilities and helpers

## Current Status

| Example | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **conflict-resolution** | ‚úÖ **Working** | Fully functional with latest API |
| **basic** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Updates** | Legacy API calls need updating |
| **utils** | ‚úÖ **Working** | Testing utilities ready for use |

## Getting Started

Each example contains its own README.md with specific instructions. Generally:

1. Navigate to the example directory
2. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
3. Run the example: `go run .`
4. Follow the specific instructions in each example's README

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- SQLite (for persistence examples)

## Architecture Patterns

These examples demonstrate various architectural patterns:

- **Event Sourcing**: All examples use event-driven state management
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation patterns
- **Offline-First**: Applications work offline and sync when connected
- **Vector Clocks**: Distributed versioning for conflict resolution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboard and metrics collection

## Building Advanced Applications

These examples serve as building blocks for more complex applications. You can combine patterns from different examples to build sophisticated distributed systems with:

- Custom storage backends
- Advanced conflict resolution strategies
- Complex event routing and filtering
- Real-time collaboration features
- Multi-tenant architectures

## Contributing

**Help Wanted!** Since these examples are work in progress, contributions are especially welcome. Ways to help:

- üîß **Fix API Compatibility**: Update examples to use the latest Go Sync Kit APIs
- üìù **Improve Documentation**: Enhance READMEs with better examples and explanations
- ‚ú® **Add New Examples**: Create examples showcasing specific use cases or patterns
- üö® **Report Issues**: File issues for examples that don't work as expected

When adding new examples:

1. Create a new directory under `examples/`
2. Include a comprehensive README.md
3. Add Go modules (`go.mod`, `go.sum`)
4. Include test files and scripts
5. Update this main README.md
6. Test with the latest Go Sync Kit version
