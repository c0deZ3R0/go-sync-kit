# Sync Manager Structured Logging Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented comprehensive structured logging for the **SyncManager** (`synckit/manager.go`), which was the most critical missing component for logging in the go-sync-kit project.

## âœ… Implementation Completed

### 1. **Core Logging Integration**
- Added `*slog.Logger` field to the `syncManager` struct
- Updated `NewSyncManager()` function to accept a logger parameter
- Integrated with the project's existing logging infrastructure (`logging` package)

### 2. **Comprehensive Logging Coverage**

#### **Main Sync Operations**
- **Bidirectional Sync (`Sync`)**: Start, completion with metrics, error handling
- **Push Operations (`Push`)**: Start, batch processing, completion with event counts
- **Pull Operations (`Pull`)**: Start, remote event retrieval, conflict resolution, completion

#### **Operation Phases**
- **Pull Phase**: Debug logging for phase start/completion with event counts
- **Push Phase**: Debug logging for phase start/completion with event counts
- **Batch Operations**: Detailed batch processing logs (batch number, size, total batches)
- **Event Filtering**: Before/after counts when filters are applied
- **Conflict Resolution**: Start, progress, and completion with resolution metrics

#### **Auto-Sync Lifecycle**
- **StartAutoSync**: Info logging for start with interval configuration
- **StopAutoSync**: Info logging for successful stops
- **Auto-sync Goroutine**: Lifecycle logging (start, stop, tick operations)
- **Auto-sync Operations**: Success/failure logging for each sync tick

#### **Error Handling & Context Management**
- **Context Cancellation**: Warn logging when operations are canceled
- **Timeouts**: Warn logging for timeout scenarios
- **General Errors**: Error logging with structured error information
- **Retry Mechanism**: Comprehensive logging for retry attempts, delays, and outcomes

#### **State Management**
- **Manager Lifecycle**: Close operations, resource cleanup
- **Subscriber Management**: Debug logging for subscriber additions and notifications
- **Subscriber Panics**: Error logging with panic recovery and sync result context

### 3. **Structured Logging Format**

All logging uses structured key-value pairs with consistent naming:

```go
// Example log entries:
sm.logger.Info("Sync operation completed successfully",
    "duration", result.Duration,
    "events_pushed", result.EventsPushed,
    "events_pulled", result.EventsPulled,
    "conflicts_resolved", result.ConflictsResolved)

sm.logger.Debug("Pushing event batch",
    "batch_number", (i/batchSize)+1,
    "batch_size", len(batch),
    "total_batches", (len(localEvents)+batchSize-1)/batchSize)
```

### 4. **Updated Integration Points**

#### **Builder Pattern**
- Updated `SyncManagerBuilder` to support logger configuration
- Added `WithLogger()` method for custom logger injection
- Default logger integration using `logging.Default().Logger`

#### **Constructor Updates**
- Modified `NewSyncManager()` signature to include logger parameter
- Updated all test files and examples to use new signature

#### **Framework Integration**
- All test files updated: `sync_test.go`, `metrics_test.go`
- All example files updated: 
  - `examples/basic/client/client.go`
  - `examples/conflict-resolution/client/client.go`
  - `examples/utils/cursor_sync.go`

### 5. **Log Levels Used**

- **INFO**: Major operations (sync start/complete, auto-sync lifecycle)
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operation phases, batch processing, event filtering
- **WARN**: Context cancellations, timeouts, retry scenarios
- **ERROR**: Operation failures, panic recovery, resource closure errors

### 6. **Key Benefits**

1. **Complete Visibility**: Every major sync operation is now logged with structured data
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Duration tracking and event count metrics
3. **Error Diagnosis**: Detailed error context with operation phase information
4. **Debugging Support**: Batch processing details, filter effects, conflict resolution progress
5. **Operational Insights**: Auto-sync behavior, retry attempts, resource management

### 7. **Test Verification**

âœ… **Build Success**: All code compiles without errors
âœ… **Test Execution**: Tests run successfully with logging output
âœ… **Example Output**:
```
time=2025-08-11T08:39:14.598+10:00 level=INFO msg="Starting bidirectional sync operation"
time=2025-08-11T08:39:14.599+10:00 level=INFO msg="Sync operation completed successfully" duration=0s events_pushed=1 events_pulled=0 conflicts_resolved=0
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Status: COMPLETE**

**The sync manager now has comprehensive structured logging implemented across all critical operations, providing complete visibility into the synchronization process with structured, machine-readable log data.**

All areas of the go-sync-kit project now have proper structured logging implementation:

1. âœ… Core logging infrastructure (`/logging/`)
2. âœ… Storage layer (`/storage/sqlite/`)
3. âœ… Transport layers (`/transport/httptransport/`, `/transport/sse/`)
4. âœ… **Sync manager (`/synckit/manager.go`) - NOW COMPLETE**
5. âœ… Error handling (`/errors/`)
6. âœ… Version management (`/version/`)
7. âœ… Examples and utilities

The logging implementation is now comprehensive and production-ready across the entire codebase.
