// Package synckit - aliases for backward compatibility and future expansion
package synckit

// This file is reserved for any future backward compatibility aliases
// or type aliases that might be needed for the synckit package consolidation.
//
// Currently, all core interfaces (Event, Version, EventStore, Transport, ConflictResolver)
// are defined directly in the synckit package, so no aliases are needed at this time.
